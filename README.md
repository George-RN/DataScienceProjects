# DataScienceProjects
This repository contains projects that I have worked on in relation to data science. They use datasets from kaggle.com and use techniques of visualising data, cleaning data, and identifying trends and producing models. The purpose of these projects is to help me practice my coding on data science and hone my skills related to these areas.

1. Movie_recommendation.py

2. Titanic ML.ipynb

3. Movie_visuals.py

4. Sales_visuals.py


Description:

1. Movie_recommendation.py - This is a program that uses the IMDB dataset from kaggle. It is a program that uses NLP to provide a recomendation of similar movies. It takes the genre and description of a title that the user has watched and filters first by genre, before looking at movies that have the highest NLP similarity in terms of their descriptive overview. I wanted to gain experience working with NLP, so some functionality is missing. For example, a real recomendation system would need to draw from actual user feedback to help inform its decisions. Similarly, this is a terminal-based script, that would realistically be used alongside some kind of GUI for an existing program. For this reason, I have not added defensive features as I would expect the GUI to restrict input types for this kind of prgoram.

2. Titanic ML.ipynb - This is a Jupyter Notebook that explains the process for the classification model used to predict whether or not a passenger would have survived the Titanic sinking based off the training data available from kaggle. 

3. Movie_visuals.py - This program uses the IMDB dataset from kaggle. It showcases data visualisations in Python using Matplotlib.

4. Sales_visuals.py -- This program uses the Walmart sales dataset from kaggle. It showcases data visualisations in Python using Matplotlib.


In order for these to work, they will require the appropriate dataset, which are linked at the bottom. 

These are all personal development projects and the coding was all done by me, but the datasets were all taken from kaggle. These can be found here:
